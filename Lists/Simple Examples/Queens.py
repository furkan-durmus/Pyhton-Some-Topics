# In chess it is known that it is possible to place 8 queens on an 8Ã—8 chess board such that none of them can attack another.
# Given a placement of 8 queens on the board, determine if there is a pair of queens that can attach each other on the next move.
# Print the word NO if no queen can attack another, otherwise print YES.
# The input consists of eight coordinate pairs, one pair per line, with each pair giving the position of a queen on a standard
# chess board with rows and columns numbered starting at 1.
# Read an integer:
# a = int(input())
# Read a float:
# b = float(input())
# Print a value:
# print(a, b)
